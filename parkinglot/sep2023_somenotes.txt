Observation
	effectivePeriod is used to indicate the "(c)linically relevant time/time-period for observation" So, when the Strength Observation needs to have an effective end date (a date after which the Observation no longer is clinically relevant) the effectivePeriod is updated. The metadata field of version for the data instance should be incremented.
	

example where using a coded numerator with a ucum coded denominator. The coded numerator in this case is more consistent than relying upon the ucum string based construct for non-units. The use of a coded term for the numerator avoids inconsistencies that might occur with string based representation. For example, a system might use the string 'session' or the string 'sessions.' But, with the use of the NCIT code for 'session' the code provides a reliable, consistent way of representing the concept of 'session.'

everything ELTSS operation
	define loosely 
	with structure
	but use narrative like the $everything operation to include description of the expected output
	use queries from Nancy's team to indicate what actions the server should perform
	

bring guidance from mapping page into each profile introduction section

ON MAPPING PAGE
	need to add http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C25716 for visit NCIT visit code is C25716
	update examples with UCUM and NCIT codes
