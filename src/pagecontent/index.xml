      This implementation guide is not fully complete.  Portions of the implementation guide are provided for "framework purposes only" - giving a sense of what additional topics are intended to be covered and where that content will fit.  The work group has prioritized standardizing those portions of the specification with general applicability.  The work group will continue to flesh out additional sections for future ballot publications.

The eLTSS Implementation Guide (IG) is based on FHIR Version R4 and defines the minimum conformance requirements for exchanging LTSS data between beneficiaries (patients), providers and care team members using non-clinical and clinical systems (e.g. EHR, PHR, HIE, case management systems, LTSS provider systems). 
</p><p>
The eLTSS data referenced in this implementation guide refers to the eLTSS Dataset that was developed by the eLTSS Initiative, a joint project between the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The eLTSS Dataset was input for the Informative Document titled “HL7 Cross-Paradigm Information Sharing for Electronic Long-Term Services and Supports (eLTSS), Release 1” balloted during the September 2018 cycle. This IG is further advancing the eLTSS dataset to FHIR mapping found in the Informative Document into FHIR-specific implementer guidance.

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The scope of this implementation guide is to describe how HCBS data requirements, documented in the 56 data elements included in the eLTSS Dataset, can be represented for exchange and sharing using FHIR.</p>
<p>The IG will use <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html">FHIR R4</a>, and <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/">FHIR US Core</a> as a starting point and will profile the following resources as necessary to enable eLTSS Plan Creation and Exchange: </p>
<p><b>TODO - Confirm this is comprehensive. point at those where we use just R4, those that we use US-Core on R4, and where we have further constraints.</b></p>

The concept of an eLTSS service plan most closely aligns with the FHIR CarePlan resource, which is semantically a good fit. The diagram below shows the FHIR resources utilized in the mapping as well as the FHIR data elements used to link these resources. Parentheses indicates the eLTSS Dataset data element (e.g. Assessed Need, Preference) or group of elements (e.g. Beneficiary Demographics, Person Indicators). Lines indicate linkages between FHIR resources and are labeled with the FHIR data element that provides the reference.</p>

<h3>US Core Dependency</h3>
<p>Please note that implementations using this eLTSS FHIR IG must comply with US Core when applicable. US Core defines the minimum conformance requirements for accessing patient data as defined by the Argonaut pilot implementations and the ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS). These profiles are intended to be the foundation for US Realm FHIR implementation guides. Therefore, <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/#us-core-profiles">US Core Profiles</a>, <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/terminology.html">US Core Terminology</a>,  <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/capstmnts.html">US Core Capability Statements / Conformance Requirements</a>, and <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/security.html">Security Considerations</a> not specifically noted in this guide must be included when applicable.</p>

<h3>eLTSS Actors</h3>
<p>The eLTSS Informative Document identified four actors who may be involved in the exchange of service plans. The table below outlines these actors and a brief description of their role in LTSS.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Beneficiary</b> Individual who is eligible for and receives LTSS. Also, referred to as recipient, consumer, person, client, participant, and individual.</li>
<li><b>Support Planner</b> Individual who helps the beneficiary explore, understand options, and make appropriate choices among community resources and services; engages in person-centered planning and assists the beneficiary with the creation, implementation and updating of a person-centered service plan.
This role is often referred to as case manager, care coordinator, etc.</li>
<li><b>HCBS Provider</b> A provider of an authorized service which assists in maintaining and enabling the beneficiary to continue living in his or her home and community (e.g. social worker, in-home supportive service provider, direct-care worker/personal care aide, adult day care provider, multipurpose older adult service program provider, case manager, personal care provider, home care agency, hospice care agency, job development and supported employment, equipment and technology, peer specialist, community integration, support broker, fiscal intermediary, and others who provide assistance in support of participant direction, etc.).</li>
<li><b>Clinical and Institutional-based Provider</b> Provider of medical or health service and any other person or organization that furnishes, bills, or is paid for health care services in the normal course of business. This includes a licensed/certified and/or qualified person who provides health care, who is authorized to implement a portion of the plan and who has care responsibilities (e.g. physician, advanced practice nurse, physician assistant, nurse, nurse practitioner, nurse care manager, psychologist, therapist, pharmacist, dietician/nutritionist, specialist, dentist, emergency department provider, etc.). 
This also includes an organization including, but not limited to a hospital including short-term acute care hospital and specialty hospital (e.g., long-term care hospital, rehabilitation facility, and psychiatric hospital, etc.), ambulatory surgery center, provider practice, and nursing home.</li>
</ul>

<p>This implementation guide will refer to US Core for actors. The eLTSS actors would play the US Core requestor role when an eLTSS plan is exchanged using FHIR. The US Core Responder actor is played by an infrastructure system not directly mentioned.:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>US Core Requestor:</b> An application that initiates a data access request to retrieve patient and service data. This can be thought of as the client in a client-server interaction.</li>
<li><b>US Core Responder:</b> A product that responds to the data access request providing patient and service data. This can be thought of as the server in a client-server interaction.</li>
